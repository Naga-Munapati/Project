Short Introduction:
This project focuses on building a machine learning–based house price prediction system. The model is trained on structured housing data and deployed through a Flask web application. The goal is to generate accurate realntime price estimates based on user inputs while demonstrating a complete ML workflow from preprocessing to deployment.
